Need a universal scraper object that will save objects as static files in the right path.
Or something.
Maybe no reason to do that.

# Need to save files locally somewhere.
# Never use urllib anymore.
# I think I'll use sha hashes in a single directory.
# Or a mongo collection (definitely a mongo collection)
