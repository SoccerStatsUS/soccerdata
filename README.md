### Soccerdata - miscellaneous soccer data.

This is the husk of the original data store of the project.

Pretty much all easily-categorized data has been migrated to a different section.

Game, statistical, and standing data can be found in indiidual repos, eg uefa-data, usd1_data.
General team, player, and other metadata can be found in metadata.



### Notes

I moved Dallas - Apollon game on 7/8/1971 forward a day for convenience. Please look up the actual date.; Likewise the Hapoel gameo on 6/30/1970, and Veracruz in 7/11/1973 (Dallas/Atlanta)b. and 6/28/1970 Hapoel /St. Louis / Washington
