1a. Create a script that will build all data.
1. News as data. Collect all the soccer news feeds. Use them to pull out interesting data.

3. Add data consistency checking.
4. Get 2010 World Cup data.

What kind of data do we have?

# Player action data
Event data
Game Stat data
Season stat data
Lineup data

# Game data
Score data

# Biographical data
Player data
 - Salary data
Team data
