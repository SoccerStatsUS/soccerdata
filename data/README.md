Principles: 

Keep original data pristine.
If necessary, preprocess it to fix whatever bugs.
Don't change the source data.

Need to standardize on a text data format. I think probably yaml would be best. Require virtuallly no parsing.

Previously, I did this:
Had to change the lineups for Dallas / Chicago game on 3/18/2000.  No substitution times listed.
FIXME: I should go back and replace this with the original file.


Current data types:

drafts:
 - list of real and fictional drafts
 - all MLS drafts
 - BigSoccer USMNT drafts.

lineups:
 - list of all-time lineups for mls. (from scaryice)

lists:
 - lists of awards, mostly. Non-quantifiable stuff.

people:
 - old mls/usl bios from me.
 - salaries data.

# Should probably replace these with a wikipedia scraper?
places:
 - list of countries by population
 - list of states with population

Ideas:
From usasoccer.blogspot.com:
All-time team win records.
In-season win charts (above/below 0 wins/goals); all-time rankings order; image of each season ranking
Tournament elimination logic.
All-time goalscorer timeline. All-time stats / goalscoring record for any date.
Break down primary / secondary assists.
Coaching statistics. Polish positions data.
US Demographics related to team locations; map of all teams in all leagues, down to NPSL. Including college.
Generate standings for any given day (amazing!).
Home field advantage - does it increase further from home? Home country advantage?
Team and player streaks; most games with a goal, most games without scoring. Most games without missing a start.
Most games without x - USMNT / not MLS; MLS / not MLS Cup; 
MLS Goal details.
MLS Penalty kicks, penalty shootouts, and the Shootout
Year-by-year team maps, with season details. Integrate into season page.
On the field all the time stats for leagues.
MLS Player of the Week
Read up on scaryice's red card stuff.
mls season ticket info.

Correct team names, but merge statistics, seasons; also competitions.
