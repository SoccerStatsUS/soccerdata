(*) crowd figures may vary (widely) from source to source; in particular for matches 
    in the 19th and early 20th century, numbers indicated can only be guesses (as
    exemplified by the indications for the first three official matches 1872-1874).
(!) goal times may differ widely between contemporary sources; minutes preceded by ~ 
    indicate the actual time may diverge by up to 5 minutes (in exceptional cases 
    even more) according to source.

[*] at the time, players did not 'belong' exclusively to a single club but often
    played for several clubs simultaneously on a regular basis; in such cases, the
    clubs indicated here are (supposedly) their "main" clubs; see the notes for 
    the first two official matches in 1872 and 1873 for examples. 

Note: "first" names listed are those under which the players were commonly known at the
      time; in a substantial number of cases, these do not correspond to their official
      first names (but e.g. to their "second" or "middle" names or variations thereof);
      in cases where the commonly used name is uncertain, both first and second names
      are given.  Many thanks to Cris Freddi for information on this topic.
Prior to any official games 5 known "internationals", sometimes called the "Alcock 
internationals", were played between a representative England side and a team of 
Scottish exiles, all of which were based in or around London. Alcock also is alleged 
to have selected the Scottish lineups! Details known are listed below and are 
reference only:
