Notes:      Henry and Moses McNiel were the first brothers to play for Scotland.

            Solicitor Samuel Llewelyn Kenrick, who captained Wales, was the first Chairman and 
            Honorary Secretary of the Football Association of Wales. In his playing career, he 
            gained five caps. Kenrick was also the referee of the match between Wales and Scotland 
            on March 14th 1881, which the Scots won 5-1.
