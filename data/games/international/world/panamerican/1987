Final Tournament

Note: The nations were mostly represented by their Olympic teams. None of the South American
      nations, nor Mexico, USA, nor Canada consider their matches as full internationals.
      However, the teams of Mexico, USA, Guatemala, El Salvador, Trinidad/Tobago, and Cuba
      may be regarded as full national teams, as the players were virtually the same as those
      who played in full internationals in this period. Canada was represented by its U-19 team. 

The Mexican federation was fined 40000 Swiss Francs by FIFA on 11/12/1987 for disorderly conduct
during the match vs Brazil. The Brazilian federation was fined 20000 Swiss Francs. The Mexican
fine was doubled because of the aggression of masseur Gerardo Albarran against the Brazilian 
delegation.
