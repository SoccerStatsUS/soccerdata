NB: on May 18, 2001, FIFA announced the tournament will be postponed to 2003,
    citing 3 reasons: national and international fixtures (which can hardly
    have come as a surprise), economic problems of some of the participants'
    home countries (never prevented a World Cup) and, crucially, the financial
    problems of ISL Worldwide, FIFA's marketing partner, which is factually
    bankrupt.  The 2003 edition was never held, a new try is planned for 2005.

Participants

Twelve teams were to be invited:

Real Madrid       - 2000 UEFA Champions' League winners
Galatasaray       - 2000 European Super Cup winners
Palmeiras         - 1999 Copa Libertadores winners
Boca Juniors      - 2000 Copa Libertadores winners
Jubilo Iwata      - 1999 Asian Super Cup winners
Al Hilal (Riyadh) - 2000 Asian Super Cup winners
LA Galaxy         - 2000 Concacaf Champions Cup winners
Olimpia           - 2000 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up
Wollongong Wolves - 2001 Oceania Champions' Cup winners
Hearts of Oak     - 2000 Africa Champions' Cup winners
Zamalek           - 2000 Africa Cup Winners' Cup winners
Deportivo (La C.) - 2000 Spanish Champions

NB: holders Corinthians not invited.
    Originally Manchester United were foreseen as 2nd European entry (as winners of
    the 1999 Champions' League), but Galatasaray were apparently far more eager to
    participate.
