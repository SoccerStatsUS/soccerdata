Austria/Habsburg Monarchy - Challenge Cup 1897-1911

The Challenge Cup was founded by John Gramlick, one of the founders of the Vienna Cricket and Football Club (better known as 'Cricketer'), in 1897. It was open to all clubs in the Habsburg Monarchy but practically restricted to teams from the three metropoles Wien, Budapest and Praha.
Originally the trophy was to be kept by the first team to win it in three consecutive seasons, but in 1903 this rule was changed and the cup made into a permanent 'Wanderpokal', no team being allowed to retain it. It is now in possession of the last winners, Wiener Sport-Club (currently called Wiener Sportklub following a short-lived merger with SV Gerasdorf and two insolvencies in the 1990s).

It can be seen as a fore-runner of both the Austrian (Viennese) cup competition started in 1918 and the renowned Mitropa-Cup started in 1927.

In the same period (the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century), the Tagblatt-Pokal (a first league championship) was played.

  [the match had finished 3-3 after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time

   minutes, sudden-death additional time); Slavia refused to play extra time
   claiming one of the 3 Cricketer goals should have been disallowed for hands
   and extra time started without Slavia players; upon the referee's whistle,
   Cricketer had little difficulty scoring a goal to win the match 4-3]

  [FC 98 withdrew after a contested goal (making it 2-1) for Vienna

   had been a former member of Vienna, contravening the rules of the
   tournament; on Nov 13, the match was awarded to Vienna, on which
   FC 98 protested; on Nov 20 the match was annulled again, after which
   Vienna withdrew from the tournament]

Final [Apr 10, 1904]
WAC            7-0 Cricketer

NB: apparently the federation and the WAC agreed before this match
    that, should the WAC win, the Cup would remain a permanent 
    Wanderpokal with no team being allowed to keep it forever.  
    This suggests that the above match was not only the Austrian
    final but possibly the final of the entire competition 1903/04,
    with no teams from Praha or Budapest entering.  Technically 
    the above match apparently did not count as final, but it most
    probably was the final match of the competition (and known to
    be so when played).

Bohemian Tournament

Final
CAFC            -  Union
  [result not yet known; possibly never played]

Hungarian Tournament

No matches played as 33 FC were the only Hungarian participants.


Final Tournament

NB: apparently all (remaining) Bohemian and Hungarian teams withdrew
    before the Austrian final on Apr 10, 1904, so the final tournament
    did not take place; its intended schedule (as drawn on Nov 1, 1903)
    was as follows:

Semifinal 
CAFC/Union      -  33 FC
  [probably never played]
WAC            bye

Final
WAC            w/o no opponent    [dns]  
1904/05

NB: [Sch 25] states that the tournament 'had rested for two years',
    apparently because no proper finals were played in 1903 and 1904.
    A tournament for 2nd class teams was organised in parallel, but no
    results are known.

Match with unclear status
[Nov 6, 1904, Hohe Warte, att: 5,000]
WAC            4-3 Vienna
  NB: [Mar 97] claims this was the 1904 final, but that does not fit
      any other source.

Preliminary Rounds
Wiener SV      5-3 Graphia
Wiener SV     11-1 Viktoria

Semifinal [Apr 23, 1905]

Wiener SV      2-1 MAC (Budapest)

NB: Wiener Sportvereinigung merged with Cyclisten-Club
    into Wiener Sport-Club (WSC) on February 25, 1907;
    Graphia merged with Schwechater SC into Germania.
1908/09

NB: WAC not allowed to enter due to conflict with other clubs.

Final [Jun 13, 1909; Hohe Warte]
Ferencváros    2-1 WSC

NB: final between the winners of tournaments in 'both halves of the Empire'
1909/10

[Sch 25] explicitly states no Challenge Cup was played; various
sources nevertheless list a final:

Final [1910]
BTC (Budapest) 2-1 WSC

but this match is not explicitly detailed anywhere and would appear
to be a mix-up with the final of the previous season.
