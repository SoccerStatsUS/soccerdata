Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes 1970

Official tournament organised by Conmebol and held once in 1970. A second edition was planned for 1971 but eventually reduced to a friendly tournament.

The mode of qualifying was different by country:

Argentina: Atlanta qualified as runners-up of the Copa Argentina 1969. 
           The winners, Boca Juniors, qualified for the Copa Libertadores 1970.
Bolivia:   Mariscal Santa Cruz as the highest-placed team not to qualify for the
           Copa Libertadores.
Chile:     Unión Española, not clear.
Ecuador:   El Nacional qualified as winners of the Copa Ecuador 1970.
Paraguay:  Libertad, not clear. 
Peru:      Deportivo Municipal as the highest-placed team in Peru not to qualify for the Copa Libertadores.
Uruguay:   Rampla Juniors qualified as winners of the Torneo de Copa 1969.
Venezuela: Unión Deportiva Canarias, apparently as runners-up of the Copa Venezuela. 
           The winners, Deportivo Galicia, qualified for the Copa Libertadores. 
Brazil and Colombia declined to participate.

Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes 1971

First Stage

Brazil and Colombia decided not to enter.

Group 1 (in Concepción, Chile, or Montevideo, Uruguay)

This group was to be played with the following teams (as reported on
January 8, 1971):

Huracán Buceo (Montevideo, Uruguay)
Deportes Concepción (Concepción, Chile)
one undefined team from Argentina (see Copa Argentina - 1970)
one undefined team from Bolivia

On February 25, 1971, Deportes Concepción withdrew and Huracán Buceo 
had not yet confirmed its participation, so, CSF decided the following:

 The tournament would be a friendly one and no cup would be awarded;
 name the referees because the tournament (in group 2) was about to start. 

Group 2 (in Quito, Ecuador, estadio Olimpico Atahualpa)

NB: played in parallel with group 5 matches of the Copa Libertadores 1971.
