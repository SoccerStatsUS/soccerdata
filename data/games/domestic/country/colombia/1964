*NB:  On 19 June 1964 the Colombian Federation of Foot-ball [Federación
*     Colombiana de Fútbol] was founded, a new body to direct the professional 
*     championship, but some regions of the country did not agree with this,
*     because the previous body "Adefútbol" had the FIFA´s approval. Because of 
*     this disagreement, Colombian teams didn´t play in the Copa Libertadores 
*     1965 and 1966; moreober, in the qualifying competition for the World Cup 
*     1966 Colombia were represented by an amateur team from the northern region
*     of the country.
