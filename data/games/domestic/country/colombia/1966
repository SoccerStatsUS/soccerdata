*NB:  After the bad results of the Colombian National Team in the qualifying 
*     series of the World Cup 1966, which was formed by different amateur
*     players from the northern region of the country (especially from 
*     Barranquilla), most of them joined the club Atlético Junior, which
*     returned to the championship after 13 years.
*     The schism of 1964 was resolved by the FIFA in an assembly in London 
*     and since 1966 Colombia returned to international championships.  The 
*     first international tournament played by Colombia was the qualifying 
*     round for the Copa América 1967 in Uruguay against Chile.
