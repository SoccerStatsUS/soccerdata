* the match Deportivo Quito-Patria was played Jan 28, 1962, and 
  finished 3-0; it later was awarded 0-2, rendering the championship
  playoff between Deportivo Quito and Emelec (who had both finished
  on 10 points before this decision), played on Jan 31, 1962 and won
  3-2 by Deportivo Quito, meaningless.

(NB: teams from the same association did not play each other)
