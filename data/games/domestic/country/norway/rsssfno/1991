This was a rather good start to a new season. Over 46.000 people attended
the games, but only 15 goals were scored (too bad). Play was overall
not too exciting but it was only the first round and with Norwegian
players you can't expect miracles so early.
 Personally I watched the Lyn- Molde game played at the newly rebuilt
national stadium ,Ullevaal. The weather was sunny ,the pitch green and 
very good so it was all set for a good game of football. After queueing
in front of the entrance for about ten minutes according to old 
Norwegian tradition (why can't they open more gates !!!!), we could 
finally find over seats just in time for the first kick-off.
 Since the first half was rather dull and scoreless without a single
shot on goal (except Sundbys header after corner which was saved on the
goalline by a Molde-defender) I'll jump right to the second half.
 After only 3 minutes came the first goal which the crowd had been
waiting for : Sundby played a triangle with Agdestein in midfield, got
the ball back , rushed into the Molde-penalty area and placed the
ball into the near post giving the Molde-keeper no chance. A brilliant
goal !! After that goal Lyn started to dominate the game and both
Tordarson with a header and Agdestein were close. Molde didn't create
a single goalchance and was to me a big disappointment. So 6 minutes
before the end Amundsen received the ball 30 metres outside the Molde-
goal. He got past one man,then another and a third too before firing
a low shot past Bakke in the Molde-goal. Another brilliant goal worth a
comparison with Baggio's goal against the Czecks in the 90'WC. 
 Now the play was rather open and in the final minutes Lyn came close
to add to their lead, but the scoreline ended 2-0. 
  After all a good start to our championshiphopes, although the play
was not too exciting. 

  Elswhere the defending champion Rosenborg could only draw 1-1 at home
to Tromsø, whilst Viking got off to a flying start as they trashed
poor Strømsgodset 5-2.

A lot of suprises this week. Defending champion Rosenborg was trashed by
Molde in a match shown live on TV and Start was well beaten at home by 
Kongsvinger. Unfortuneately Lyn lost too , deservedly 0-1 to an agressive
Fyllingen-side in Bergen. But we shall come back !!
 In this week top match Viking beat Lillestrøm 2-1 to go top of the 
table with maximum points . The victory was very convincing and Viking
already look like champoinship material. They attacked with three 
forwards throughout the game and never sat back and held on to their lead.
A great tribute to their Swedish manager Benny Lennartson.
  The two remaining matches ended with a draw. The scoreline from Drammen
(Strømsgodset vs Sogndal) says it all, while the most exciting thing from
Tromsø was that the game was played partly in snowy conditions !!!.

Viking is still top of the table after beating a defensive Tromsø 2-0 in
front of over eleven thousand in Stavanger. Lyn (my team) and Lillestrøm
had good wins and are the closest rivals. While Rosenborg is still
without a win after struggling against a rejuvenated Brann who got
their midfield ace Per Egil Ahlsen back from professional football this
weekend . He was playing for Fortuna Dusseldorf but couldn't catch a
regular place in the team. The two remaining matches ended in 1-1 draws
between KIL and Strømsgodset, and Molde and Fyllingen respectively.

After a round on thursday with only eight goals , this weekends matches
produced not more than 27 goals (4.5 per match). I attended the Lyn-Lillestrøm
game , which was played on a sunny with very windy afternoon here in Oslo.
 We hadn' t got to our seats before the first goal came. A cross from the 
left was met on the chest by Thordarsen and with not a single Lillestrøm
defender within a mile , it was a simple task to fire a low shot into the
left corner giving Grodaas no chance. That's it we thought. Let us show
the peasants from Lillestrøm what Lyn is made of !!!!
 (Lillestrøm is (beside Rosenborg) the team in Norway everyone (except 
their fans) love to hate . They are also situated just outside Oslo
so this match is the closest you can get to an Oslo-derby these days).
 The next five minutes Lyn had at least 3 good chances to add to their
lead. Lillestrøm looked shocked but they recovered quikly. A freekick from
the right was headed home by Johansen with the Lyn-defence watching.
 Fortunately Lyn hit straight back with a beatuful shot from Sundby just
inside the penalty-area. The rest of the half was evenly fought with 
good attacking football from both sides.
 After the break the quality of the match sunk a bit , but we were
encouraged by the news from Stavanger that Viking couldn't beat Brann. 
If we won and they didn't we would go top of the table.
 Suddenly our dreams were shattered. A thundering shot from Johansen
just outside the area was only half-cleared by Rossbach and there was
Arnevaag to tap in the rebound. But again Lyn recovered quickly.
 A fine long ball found Fodstad, who got past his defender and sent a
lovely cross from the right to Bergesen who blasted his shot past Grodaas.
What a goal !! And we were now top of the table.!!! 
 In the rest of the match no great chances occured so the result stood.
As we were leaving the ground the speaker announced that Viking had won
after all. So we wasn't to be top of the table. But who cares it is 17
matches still to be played !!!!

 Elsewhere the big negative suprise is that defending champion Rosenborg
is bottom of the table without a win this season. Yesterday they lost
and deservedly too 3-1 away to newly promoted Sogndal. Actually almost
the same thing happened last time they were defending champions ,so who
knows maybe they can't handle beeing number one? Kongsvinger is the
suprise team at the moment  scoring 5 goals against Tromsø is very good,
considering Tromsø's reputation as a very well-organised team defensively.
 Maybe they could cause an upset ? 
At the bottom it's very tight only four points seperating the last eight.
Strømsgodset got off the bottom with a lucky win against Fyllingen while
Start got their second win in a row after having a disasterous start.

3-2 B.Meinseth (88)


Viking still lead the field after a dramatic 3-2 win over Molde.
They were twice a goal behind but came back and got the winner in the
final minutes. At the moment they look like a very strong side, and most
important, they never give up a match , despite being a goal down.

Lyn got an important away point in Tromsø in a very entertaining
match. So we keep the pressure on Viking. 

At the bottom Rosenborg and Brann were unable to win this week as well.
They both got 0-0 draws. Rosenborg dominated the play against 
KIL totally , had four goals disallowed for offside (one very suspiciously)
but couldn't put the ball in the net. Brann couldn't break down
the Sogndal-defense in a tame and dull match.

Elsewhere there were wins for an improving Start away to Strømsgodset
(third in a row) and for Lillestrøm against Fyllingen (first at home).

A lot of big suprises this weekend with the top three teams only gaining
one single point whilst the bottom four all had important (and big as well)
wins.  The most chocking results was Moldes 0-7 thrashing at home to
lowly Strømsgodset. This was Moldes heaviest home defeat ever and it
led to speculation that their manager ex-international Åge 'Oggie for
Norwich and Man.City fans' Hareide would resign. After a meeting with the 
board on Sunday eve he keeps his job and the players took full 
responsibility for the latest weak results and pledged him to stay.
 Third-placed Kongsvinger lost at home as well 1-2 to Brann which
got their first win of the season (as did Rosenborg I'll come back to
their match later in this posting) when they turned a half-time
deficit into a narrow win with two goals in the second half. 
 The current leader Viking could only draw in Sogndal where the
home team was the best team but Viking escaped with one vital point. 
Elsewhere Fyllingen finally managed to put some of the numerous chances they
always create in the net and thereby beating Tromsø 3-0, while Start
got their fourth win in a row after defeating a defensive Lillestrøm by
a single goal. 
 Last but not least (if you are a RBK-fan ) let's focus on this
weekends top match played here in Oslo in front of just over 10k: 
 Lyn-Rosenborg. I was at Ullevaal of course , hoping to experience some
of the magic moments from Wed. once again. It all started well from
my point of view. The first half hour totally belonged to Lyn. They
created plenty of good opportunities after some neat football , but couldn't 
put the ball in the net . Obviously their lack of a descent forward 
alongside Fodstad ,after Agdesteins long-term injury, was shining through.
 In this part of the game Rosenborg was totally outclassed as in the season
so far and hardly had a shot on target.
 Their first good chance came after forty minutes from a header by Løken
which was well saved by Rossbach. By then Lyn had slipped up a bit and had
allowed RBK back in the game. Was it a omen of what to expect in the second
half ??
 To all the Lyn-fans out there I'm sorry to say : it was !!
After only seven minutes Rosenborg receives a corner from the right which
is headed onto the crossbar by Soerloth. Sollied is first to the rebound
and buries the ball in the net from close range. After this goal Rosenborg
never looked back whilst Lyn fell totally apart. The second goal was
a magnificent strike from Sørloth who received the ball in midfield and 
sprinted towards goal. Although he was under pressure from two Lyn-defenders
he managed to keep the ball in posession and from 20 metres he sent a
thunderous shot into the upper right corner. A deadly finish.
A few minutes later he should have made it 3-0 when he was totally clear 
but his shot was well saved by Rossbach. But we didn't need to wait a long
time for number three. Lyn lost posession in the RBK-half and a quick 
counterattack involving Ingebrigtsen and Løken sent Brandhaug free and
he scored with ease. Now Lyn had totally fallen to pieces and Brandhaug
made it 4-0  a few minutes later turning Dyrstad away in the penalty area 
and placing a low shot beyond Rossbachs reach. From this moment on
Rosenborg seemed content and let Lyn into the game again. However Lyn
was still unable to score and the final whistle came as a relief to me.
This win was Rosenborgs first this season and put a severe dent to my
hopes of seeing Lyn as champions. If they don't by a new striker I don't
think we will be able to challenge Viking at the top any longer.
 As for Rosenborg this win might be the turning point in an indifferent   
season so far. They are ten point adrift of Viking but with 15 games
left I wouldn't count them out yet.

Viking went seven poins clear after beating third-placed KIL 1-0 in
Stavanger but not after an impressive display. Lyn lost unfortuneately
3-0 in Bergen and what's worse they played awfully and had Bjerkeland and
Haugen injured. Last week their most valuable player ex-international
Tom Sundby was injured and their biggest threat up front Agdestein is
out since May. Brann on the other hand are playing better and better after
Ahlsens return to the club. It now looks all set for Viking which have good 
reserves on every place in the team compared to Lyn which are too dependent 
of their star-players. We'll see next week when the two teams meet in Oslo.
  Elsewhere Rosenborg got their second win after beating struggling 
Fyllingen 2-1 at home although Fyllingen took the lead and pressed the
home-team for most of the game. Lillestrøm and Strømsgodset shared the
points in a lively game as did Sogndal and Molde in a game as boring
as the scoreline suggests. In the last game Tromsø gained three 
valuable points sending Start home with their first defeat after four
wins in a row.
