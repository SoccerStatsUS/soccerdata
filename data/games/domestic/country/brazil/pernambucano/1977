The last match of the final was marked by an odd happening caused by the
tournament rules: the decisive goal that would award Sport the title was scored
by Sport's player Mauro at the 148th minute!  The rules stated that if Náutico
won the match, the teams would have to dispute the overtime, but there would be
no penalties shootouts if the overtime ended in a draw.  So the match would end
only after a team emerged as winner after the end of an overtime period.  After
4 overtime periods of 15 minutes, Sport emerged the winner of this "match of
attrition".
