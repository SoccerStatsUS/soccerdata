  at first, and goal differences (and amounts of goals) secondly. 
* Adopted with J.League, JFL introduced "V-Goal" sudden-death 
  (30 minutes) and penalty shoot-out (5 players) system for 
  its game in league.
* In this season, for preparing to join J.League, Yamaha and 
  Hitachi changed its name, "Jubilo Iwata" and "Kashiwa Raysol". 
  It was like J.League clubs, combination of hometown's name and 
  nickname.
* "Kyoto Purple Sanga" was "Kyoiku Kenkyusha FC Kyoto Purple Sanga" 
  in official. The name was changed from "Kyoto Shiko Club".

  in J.League.
* Toho Titanium was relegated to regional, Kanto Soccer League.
