Season: 1994
Competition: J. League

*Note that there are no draws in the J.League. Games that end in a draw
*after 90 minutes go to "sudden-death" extra time (i.e. the game ends
*as soon as one of the teams scores), and if the game is still
*undecided after 30 minutes of extra time penalty kicks are taken.

*In the results tables 1-0 is a result reached in normal time, 1=0
*means the game went to extra time. If the score is drawn the game went
*to penalties: > indicates a home win, < an away win.

*Verdy Kawasaki win the 1994 J.League Championship.


*Notes:
** JFL changed its form from double (each in 10 teams) to 
*  mono-class league, includes 16 teams.
** The games were played under sudden-death (30 minutes) and 
*  penalty shoot-out (5 players) system. 
** The Rank was decided by the amounts of wins (with all of types) 
*  at first, and goal differences secondly. 
** Three clubs were recognized as J.League associate members, 
*  Cerezo Osaka (renamed from Yanmer Diesel, before the season), 
*  Kyoto Purple Sanga and PJM Futures (in this season).
** Cerezo Osaka and Kashiwa Raysol were promoted to J.League 
*  from next season.
** PJM Futures was relocated from Hamamatsu (in Shizoka) to Tosu 
*  (in Saga) in the middle of this season. 
*  But, the new stadium in Tosu was under construction, 
*  and PJM still held its game in Shizuoka till the end.
** After this season, Fujieda Blux (in Fujieda, Shizuoka) and 
*  Kawasaki Steel (in Kurashiki, Okayama) changed its name and 
*  hometown, to "Fukuoka Blux" (in Fukuoka City, Fukuoka pref.) 
*  and "Vissel Kobe" (in Kobe, Hyogo). These two clubs became 
*  J.League associate members, but Vissel Kobe encountered  
*  the big, Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake on Jan 17, 1995.
** Kofu Soccer Club changed its name to "Ventforet Kofu" after 
*  this season.
** From next season, two clubs were promoted from regional,
*  both from Tohoku, Fukushima FC and Brummel Sendai.
