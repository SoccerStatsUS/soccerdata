[total GD -1]

Nacional and Bella Vista qualify for Copa Libertadores, Danubio
and Penarol for Copa Conmebol 1993.

NOTE: The intervention of a Catholic priest, Ernesto POPELKA, a former player
      with Danubio and Nacional, helped to end a month-long players' strike.
      The Uruguay FA had suspended two Second Division clubs for a month after
      their fans had caused trouble (one man dead and several injured) - a
      decision which hurt the players, who had nothing to do with it. Their
      players remained unpaid and the union called a strike, which stopped the
      championship and caused Nacional's elimination from the South American 
      Super Cup for Copa Libertadores winners.

Topscorer:
  
1. Julio Dely Valdez (Nacional/PAN)      13 goals
2. Antonio Vidal Gonzalez (Nacional/ARG)  8 goals
  
NB: Nacional won their 24th title, their first since 1983.
