*Nacional and Bella Vista qualify for Copa Libertadores, Danubio and Penarol for Copa Conmebol 1993.

* NOTE: The intervention of a Catholic priest, Ernesto POPELKA, a former player with Danubio and Nacional, helped to end a month-long players' strike. The Uruguay FA had suspended two Second Division clubs for a month after their fans had caused trouble (one man dead and several injured) - a decision which hurt the players, who had nothing to do with it. Their players remained unpaid and the union called a strike, which stopped the championship and caused Nacional's elimination from the South American Super Cup for Copa Libertadores winners.
