Semifinals [May 8]

Pouderoyen         1-1 Santos                    [aet, 5-3 pen]
NB: both losing finalists lodged a protest; as a result, Santos were
    awarded a win while the Tigers-Pele match was ordered to be replayed
    in a fairly ludicrous decision undoubtedly influenced by the facts
    that 1) the tournament has the highest prize money ever in Guyanese
            football (one million of the local dollars); 
         2) the president and 1st vice-president of Santos happen to 
            double as 2nd vice-president and secretary of the organising
            Georgetown League; and
         3) Pouderoyen, unlike the other three semi-finalists, are not
            from Georgetown.
    Pouderoyen have appealed the ruling.

On May 27, the Appeals Committee of the  GFF (Guyana Football Federation)
recommended to reprimand the GFL (Georgetown Football League) for bringing 
football into disrepute, and to replay the tournament but only after the
GFF was fully satisfied with registration of clubs and players participating 
in the competition.
