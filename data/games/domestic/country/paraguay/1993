NB: The championship 1993 was abandoned.
    Olimpia, unbeaten this season after 27 games, were running away with
    the championship as the final round was in progress when their great
    rivals, Cerro Porteño, stopped the competition.
 
    First Olimpia's game with Colegiales had to be cancelled because
    unknown individuals had dug holes all over the field (curiously Cerro
    Porteño's field). Then Cerro Porteño obtained a court order to stop the
    championship because of rule infringements.
 
    The loss of points (for apparently fielding an unregistered player) by
    Sport Colombia meant that Cerro Cora moved up into a tie with
    Presidente Hayes and forced a play-off for a final round place. But
    Presidente Hayes, not agreeing with the measure, decided not to turn up
    for the play-off which let Cerro Cora into the final round. But, said
    Cerro Porteño, the league's rules do not cover "walkovers" so that
    Cerro Cora's participation in the final round was unlawful ...... and
    the courts stopped play.

    This prompted the national sports council to make the league
    investigate irregularities which, apart from breaking their own laws
    (also regarding registration of players), also included unclear
    handling of TV  deals and ticket sales for recent World Cup qualifying
    games. As a result all Paraguayan FA officials renounced their
    positions.

    FIFA sent a fax threatening Paraguay with international suspension if
    government intervention did not cease by December 13.
 
    Government intervention into the affairs of the Paraguayan FA,
    investigating financial and other irregularities, was lifted hours
    before FIFA'S deadline threatening the FA with suspension. But the
    championship was not restarted. 
 
    Instead First Division club presidents voted 2-1 in favour to declaring
    Olimpia champions ...... for 33rd time.
    Cerro Porteño were declared vice-champions and play Cerro Cora -
    according the rules - for a place in the Libertadores Cup.


SECOND PLACE PLAY-OFF (for Copa Libertadores)

Cerro Porteño   3-1     Cerro Cora (winner Copa Republica)
Cerro Cora      1-1     Cerro Porteño   

Cerro Porteño Asuncion qualified for Copa Libertadores 1994.    



TOPSCORER:

Francisco FERREIRA (Sportivo Luqueño)   13 goals


NB: Second Division.
    Sport Ameliano 0-2 General Caballero
    The referee William Weiler sending off 20 players!
    He began by dismissing two of the home team, which provoked an
    argument. Opposing General Caballero players joined in, and after a
    free-for all Weiler sent off all the remaining home men and nine of the
    visitors.
