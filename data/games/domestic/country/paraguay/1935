Segunda División (for Copa Intendencia Municipal)

Champions: Presidente Hayes (promoted)

A dissident league under the name 'Liga Centenario' (later called
Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol) was formed, with as participants in
its initial season: Bahía Blanca (champions), El Triunfo (Ypacaraí),
Marte Atlético (Luque), Vencedor (Luque), 14 de Mayo, Sport Asunceno,
Boy Scouts, Unión Paraguaya, Mariscal López, Sastre Sport and River 
Plate.  It organised seven championships before folding in 1917.
1912

NB: played for the Copa el Diario (issued by newspaper of that name).

Final Table:
 1.Olimpia             6  4  1  1          9

 4.Presidente Hayes    6                   2  Relegated

NB: Nacional did not show for final match against Olimpia, thereby
    handing their opponents the title at the cost of Sol de América.
    Guaraní and Mbiguá were allowed ('for once') to abstain from 
    participation without losing top level status.
    Presidente Hayes lost various matches by walk-over and were
    temporarily dissolved after the season (reappearing in 1917).

Segunda División: no tournament (other sources give Guaraní as winners,
                  presumably because they re-entered the top level 1913).

Liga Centenario 1912: Atlántida and Libertad joined this rebel league;
champions were River Plate (won decisive match 8-0 against Bahía Blanca).
1913

NB: played for the Copa el Diario (issued by newspaper of that name).

As the league statutes required it to have at least 5 participants,
a qualifying tournament was held for clubs aspiring to enter.  It was
won by Cerro Porteño; the other 3 participants were 10 de Agosto (San
Lorenzo), El Porvenir (Ypacaraí) and River Plate.

Round 1 [Aug 3]
Cerro Porteño  5-1 Nacional 
Sol de América w/o Olimpia 
Guaraní        bye

    but not confirmed by contemporary newspapers; Olimpia may have won the
    championship outright; the known results from the Nacional and El Diario
    newspapers suggest Olimpia had a considerable advantage in points

NB: Cerro Porteño's nickname (El Ciclón de Barrio Obrero) apparently

Segunda División (for Copa Intendencia Municipal)

Champions: Marte Atlético (Luque), runners-up: 10 de Agosto (San Lorenzo);
           Marte renounced on promotion, supposedly in order to be able to

Libertad
1916

NB: played for the Copa el Diario (issued by newspaper of that name).

NB: River Plate's total missing from source and computed on the assumption
    that all clubs played 12 matches.

Thanks to their third win, Olimpia were allowed to keep the trophy (Copa
el Diario).

Segunda División (for Copa Intendencia Municipal)

Champions: Marte Atlético (Luque) (unbeaten); thanks to their win Marte
           Atlético were allowed to keep the trophy (Copa Intendencia

    relegated (or withdrew) rather than Sol de América.

Champions: Villa del Salto (won championship final 3-2 against 
           Cerro Porteño B but renounced on promotion for economic
           reasons).

NB: Sol de América is missing from the above table; as the points 
    totals (which add up to 157) make no sense if only 9 teams
    played (making for 72 matches or 144 points), it can be assumed
    they did actually play; in case all 10 teams finished all 18
    matches, no points were deducted and the points totals given
    above are all correct, Sol should have finished on 23 points.

División Intermedia 

Champions: Cerro Porteño B

NB: following the title of Cerro Porteño's reserve team it was
    decided to restrict the 2nd level to teams eligible for 
    promotion in case they would win the competition.

Instead of Cerro Porteño B, Club Atlético Triunfo gained access
to the first division; they were different from El Triunfo (Ypacaraí).

NB: competition finished on April 9, 1922 (!)

NB: Triunfo listed with 9 points in source but not equal in place
    with Atlántida; as the sum of points would be 184 (4 more than
    possible) if they really would have obtained 9 points, it is
    assumed this is a typo and should actually read 5.

    matches and at which the 'Copa Congreso' was at stake.

Final Match (decisive for title)
C.A.L.T.       3-1 Presidente Hayes

NB: in spite of their loss, Presidente Hayes were declared champions by
    the Liga Paraguaya, on the grounds that C.A.L.T. (Compañia Americana

    did not possess their own field.

Promoted: C.A.L.T., Presidente Hayes, Presidente Alvear and Universo.

1931

Start: May 3, 1931; ended: Jun 26, 1932.

NB: season suffered from a long interruption due to the political
    circumstances as well as a proposed rebel federation (the
    'Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol', supported by Libertad,
    Cerro Porteño, Nacional, Guaraní, River Plate, Sol de América
    and General Caballero) which eventually did not come into
    being; after the first half of the season Universo led the
    table with 23 points but after the restart on Feb 8, 1932, 
    they soon disappeared from that unfamiliar spot.

Top Final Ranking:

1935

On Jul 7, 1935, the Liga Paraguaya excluded various clubs to reduce
the number of top flight teams, ruling that participating clubs must
possess a playing field within the borders of Asunción.  Because of
this, Presidente Alvear, Sportivo Luqueño, C.A.L.T., Universo and
General Caballero were excluded from participation.  However, C.A.L.T.,
possessing a modern stadium and influential directors, were later
admitted to the league.

NB: only a 'half' championship was organised.

NB: C.A.L.T. were forced to rename after the season, as a football club
    was not allowed to advertise a private company; they chose the name
    Atlético Corrales after a battle of that name.

Topscorer: Pedro Osorio (Cerro Porteño) 16 goals

División Intermedia

On Oct 29, 1935, the league decided to suspend the championships of the
lower divisions including the Intermedia.  It was later decided to grant 
Sportivo Luqueño the right of participation in the 1936 championship.
1936

NB: championship was abandoned in November 1936 in order to prepare a
    good team for the South American championship in Buenos Aires at 
    the end of December.  On Feb 28, 1937, it was decided not to resume
    the league and declare leaders Olimpia champions.

NB: after 15 rounds, Guaraní had led with 24 points, holding a 4-point

    won their last 3 matches, Guaraní managed only 1 draw.

Championship Playoff 

First Leg
Nacional       3-0 Cerro Porteño

Second Leg 
Nacional       w/o Cerro Porteño

NB: Cerro Porteño protested against Nacional fielding Arsenio Erico in
    the first match, as Erico had already played for Independiente in
    Argentina; the 'Tribunal de Penas' decided the relevant article in
    the regulations, prohibiting players to play for two clubs during
    the season, only applied if both clubs were Paraguayan and let the
    result stand; thereupon, Cerro Porteño withdrew.

Topscorer: Francisco Sosa (Cerro Porteño) 23 goals

NB: this was a competition played as a single round robin ahead of
    the official championship, between 1942 and 1952; it was also

    total is incorrect and should read 13 (or otherwise they should
    have played off with Presidente Hayes against relegation)

    it is not clear why (possibly some sort of 'promedio' was

    General Caballero).

Relegation decided by 'promedio' (average over past 3 seasons); apparently
Sportivo Luqueño and Tembetary were the worst two clubs according to this
ranking, but this appears to imply there are errors in the points totals
given: both Sol de América and Sportivo San Lorenzo had worse records
over the previous three seasons than both Sportivo Luqueño and Tembetary.
