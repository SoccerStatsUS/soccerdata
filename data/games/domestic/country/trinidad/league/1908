[*] includes championship play-off between Clydesdale and Casuals who
    had both finished on 17 points.

NB: goals against of Local Forces missing in sources; in order for the
    table to add up, they should have conceded 38 goals (in which case
    they logically should have been ranked 4th) but goal records of other
    teams (in particular QRC!) are highly suspect.  The original source
    (http://tnt.fifa.com/files/tto/92.pdf) mixed up draws and losses and
    presumably made mistakes with goal records as well.
