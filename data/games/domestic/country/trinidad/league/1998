Bottom four join top regional teams in the "Champion of Champions" (sic!)
league to decide entry in next season's league, which is supposed to be
fully professional.

"Big Four" Competition

[post-season competition for the top-4 in the country.  If
Queen's Park or San Juan Jabloteh win, they will be allowed
into the Caribbean club championships.]

First Round (Oct 20)
Joe Public        2-1 San Juan Jabloteh
Caledonia AIA     4-1 Queen's Park


"Champions of Champions League"

Round 1 (Nov 7)
---------------
Stokely Vale (Tobago)    8-1 Klans (North)
Police (South)           3-1 Harvard (North)
Fire Services (SPFL)     2-3 Doc's Khelwalaas (Central)
Carib FC (SPFL)          1-0 Caroni (Central)
St. Francois (North)     4-0 Mayaro United (Eastern)
Superstar Rangers (SPFL) ppd Roxborough Lakers (Tobago) (poor field)

(in total 20 teams are playing for 4 spots in the professional league 1999.)


Apparently the following eight teams have qualified for the 1999 Pro League:

Defence Force, Joe Public, San Juan Jabloteh, Futgof, Point Fortin, Doc's
Khelwalaas, Williams Connection, and Police.

It would seem Doc's Khelwalaas and Police qualified through the 
"Champions of Champions" League.  Where Futgof and Williams Connection
come from is unclear, as is the fate of Caledonia AIA, Queen's Park,
Uprising Youths and United Petrotrin who had supposedly qualified
through the regular season.  An additional condition for admission
to the PFL 1999 (Professional Football League) was a bank draft
guaranteeing TT$750,000 (ca. US$ 125,000).  Apparently Caledonia and
Queen's Park asked for more time to get the money together but were 
denied.  Queen's Park, after their good season, will get out of football
business and sell its players.  The other teams will remain in the SPFL,
which will act as a feeder league (so in effect 2nd level) to the PFL.
