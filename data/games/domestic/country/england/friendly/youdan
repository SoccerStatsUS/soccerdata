Competition: Tommy Youdan Cup
Season: 1867

*England - Tommy Youdan Cup 1867

*It was the first competition with a trophy in one of the different codes of football. 
*Tommy Youdan, a Sheffield theatre owner, sponsored it. The cup went missing for many years until in 1997 a Scottish antiques dealer contacted the club to inform them he had in his possession a trophy won by Hallam in 1867. The trophy turned out to be the Youdan Cup and Hallam FC promptly bought it back for £2000!
