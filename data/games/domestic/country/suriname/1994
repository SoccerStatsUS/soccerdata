NB: a final match on Nov 14, 1995 is reported, in which Robinhood
    beat Leo Victor 4-3 (goals: Robbie Poetisie, Steven Righters,
    Steven Belgrave and Umberto Klinker for Robinhood and 
    Etienne Remak, Harley Overman and Ramon Kempenaar for Leo
    Victor) to claim the championship; presumably this just refers
    to the final round and not a championship playoff


Presidents Cup 1995

Final:
Robinhood            2-0 Corona Boys  


NB: in previews for the 2008 Presidents Cup final it is claimed the 1995
    Presidents Cup was not held, in which case the above final may have 
    been that of the regular cup competition (whose winners are not known)
