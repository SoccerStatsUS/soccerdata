tour: Corinthians
year: 1924

The Corinthian tour of 1924 was nowhere near as successful as the previous tours in 1906 and 1911, not only in terms of results, but also in terms of the numbers of fans showing up to see them. When the Canadian part of the tour was completed, the Corinthians travelled across the border and played in Philadelphia, Brooklyn and Haverford, Pennsylvania.

Corinthians players who made the tour in 1924:

N.E.C. Ashton, G.C. Bambridge, F.H. Barnard, L.B. Blaxland, C. Wreford-Brown, A.H. Chadder, F.N.S. Creek, C.H. Davies, R.W. de Koven, C.B.G. Hunter, J.G. Knight, H.G. Lewis, V. E. Morgan, J.S.F. Morrison, C.E. Glenister, C.B. Partridge, J.K. Reid, H.F. Robinson, T. Lashmer.

This was the year in which there was a division in Ontario soccer between the Ontario Football Association and the Canadian Football Association formed in opposition to the OFA. The team selected to represent Ontario was selected by the OFA. But it should be noted that although the game was played in Hamilton, there were no Hamilton players on the team. It was also the only time during the tours before 1940 that a game between a team representing Ontario played outside of Toronto.
