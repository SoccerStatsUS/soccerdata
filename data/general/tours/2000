Season: 2002

* 2002
* One of the biggest announcements on the Tour front was the agreement to bring Manchester United over for a four city tour of MLS venues against major international clubs in 2003. This would be Manchester United's first visit to the US since the early 1980s, and revive what was one of the best series during the heyday of the tours back in the early 1950s. Once again, an extensive series of exhibition matches was played between MLS teams and international clubs.
* The ChampionsWorld series again took place, pitting Manchester United and several other prominent European teams against each other in a series of exhibitions at major cities throughout the US. Once again, the series was very successful, drawing large crowds (see separate section above). MLS again sent a number of their teams on tour in Europe as part of their spring training regimen. The US performances continued to improve, with the MetroStars even winning the La Manga Cup.

* World Series of Football
* Once again, major world soccer clubs toured the United States, but this time some of their matches were against MLS clubs, making a return to the tradition of domestic competition against touring clubs. Championsworld had met its demise at the end of 2004, but MLS chose to inaugurate their own series of high-level exhibition matches, the centerpiece being four matches designated the "World Series of Football." The teams involved included Real Madrid, Chelsea, and A. C. Milan. Real Madrid also toured with its own series of friendly matches. The matches against Milan and Chelsea were highly anticipated, both teams being defending champions of their respective leagues. Unlike international tours of years past, the clubs brought most of their top players with them.
* The first friendly was a match between Real Madrid and Chivas, which Real won 3-1. On September 19, Real took to the field against the Los Angeles Galaxy before a sold-out house at Carson. The Galaxy were shut out 2-0, but it was a respectable match for an MLS club against a top world team. Real Madrid dominated throughout the first half, with Michael Owen scoring in the 6th minute off a shot from Zinzedane Zidine. David Beckham nearly hit the net later in the half. In the second half, the Galaxy made some impressive attacks, coming close, but were not able to find the net. Roberto Soldano scored in the 7th minute. Although the teams played fairly evenly for the rest of the game, the Galaxy didn't score.
* On July 24, Chelsea FC returned to the Boston area for the first time since their 1967 matches against Eintracht Braunschweig of Germany, to take on A. C. Milan. Dutch winger Arjen Robben scored in the 13th minute for the only goal of the game. Chelsea was very well prepared and had a deep roster, but the game was very close; Chelsea had replaced their entire roster by the start of the second game. Both teams were playing at near-full intensity, and the crowd got their money's worth.
* The Chicago Fire gave it their all against A. C. Milan on July 28, but still came short 3-1. It was a good game though, with Chicago keeping Milan hemmed in for long stretches Chris Rolfe led several impressive runs for the Fire in the first half, but Milan found the net first, with Christian Vieri landing the goal in the 21st minute. Chris Rolfe evened the score less than a minute later with a 20-yard shot into the side netting. Rolfe continued to make impressive attacks throughout the half. The Fire started aggressively in the 2nd half, but during a string of Fire substitutions, Milan found their footing and landed the go-ahead goal in the 76th minute, with Serginho scoring the final one in stoppage time to give Milan the 3-1 win.
* On the same day, D. C. United took on Chelsea FC at Landover, MD, surprising and delighting the crowd by taking the offense in the early going, and landing the first goal, courtesy of Bobby Boswell in the 31st minute. Four minutes later, Damian Huff equalized for Chelsea, and Hernan Crespo broke the tie in the 57th minute. Both sides had good scoring opportunities from then on, but no shot reached the net, although Freddy Adu gave the Chelsea defenders fits with his agile moves. A final failed shot by Clyde Simms sealed United's doom.
* Other games included a 5-0 Real Madrid victory over the MLS Select team, a 1-0 victory by D. C. United over Chelsea and a rather uneventful 1-1 draw between Chelsea and AC Milan at the Meadowlands. Although crowds were smaller than the Championsworld series, these were the first involving matches against MLS clubs and still drew fairly well. Overall, a very successful tour. High attendance, world teams bringing over their "A" squads, a far call from the tours of years past.

* The World Series of Soccer was expanded in 2006 to seven teams, and a number of other international exhibitions also took place. This provided MLS fans with some excellent opportunities to see top-notch club soccer. The games were a combination of matches between MLS and touring teams, and touring teams against each other, some of them doubleheaders with MLS games, others stand alone matches at MLS and non-MLS venues. The major highlights were visits by FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Celtic, Chivas Guadalajara and Club America. Two of the more satisfying wins was Chivas USA's 1-1 draw with Chivas Guadalajara, and DC United's 1-1 draw against Real Madrid before 66,830 at Seattle. Although DC United dominated more convincingly in their 4-0 win over Celtic at Washington, Celtic hardly comes from a powerhouse national league (Scotland). Although many of the games drew MLS-sized crowds, several sold quite well, including a sellout of 92,650 at Los Angeles for a battle between FC Barcelona and Chivas Guadalajara, and a 70,002 sellout at Giants Stadium that saw FC Barcelona win convincingly over Red Bull New York.
* The games served multiple purposes. Besides continuing a tradition of welcoming overseas teams that goes back to the early parts of the 20th century, the games generate interest in MLS cities for top-notch soccer, and are lucrative both for the visiting team and for the league. If the games demonstrated the gap between MLS teams and the best international teams, they also showed that the gap was closing, although no one was saying it wouldn't be a long haul before reaching parity. As in the past, the tours provided some time for goodwill activities; as Chelsea trained for a week at UCLA, and attended a meet and greet with local dignitaries; and Barcelona players hobnobbed with NASA officials at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The result of all this was a profit for Soccer United Marketing, and a lot of great soccer.
